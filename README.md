**or**

  1. With [Git](https://git-scm.com/), you can write the follow command to clone the repository:
      - ```bash
        $git clone  https://github.com/Eric-Gabriel-Larroque/API_Criptomoeda_JS.git    
  
  2. You 'll need a key to get access to cmm API, too. Its just create your account here:
     - [Create CMC Account](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)  
  
  3. At long last, to avoid API request issues, you'll need to install the follow extension from ([Moesif](https://www.moesif.com/?int_source=corsextension)). Keep the extension on while running the project:
       - [for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc)
       - [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/moesif-origin-cors-changer1/)
       - [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cors-unblock/hkjklmhkbkdhlgnnfbbcihcajofmjgbh)
  
  4. after getting your API key creating your account, insert the key in the commented field in the js file (otherwise, if you want to develop this project, hide the key by exporting it from another js or json file).
  5. It seems great, now you can run the project :)
